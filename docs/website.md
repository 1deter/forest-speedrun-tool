# forest.deter.cloud - brief for the website session

Next up 10, started next (author, 2026-09-27: "get everything done and
start working on the site - i'm pretty excited to see what can be done").
Built by Claude (author, 2026-09-25: "do whatever's easiest"). This file is
the starting point; decisions made while building go here too.

## What it is for

- **Shared runs and a web viewer** (runner request): everyone's runs of a
  spot against yours, in the style of Momentum Mod - lines, ghosts, splits.
- **Leaderboards are comparative, not competitive** (CLAUDE.md
  *Conventions*): lines and ghosts, no verified ranking, so no anti-cheat.
  Deleting a run and flagging a time faster than the golds is enough.
- Later: 3D terrain from the heightmap, caves (need a geometry dump), a
  scrub bar, annotations.

## Decided with the author (2026-09-25 / 27)

- **Spots stay curated in the repo, runs go to the site.** Community
  spots (`community/*.foseg` + `index.txt`) are approved by the author for
  now; later runner-managed and hands-off. The site should be able to
  take a *spot submission* (a `.foseg`) for the author to approve, since
  runners will not open pull requests.
- **Run uploads:** off until the site is live, then **automatic** (author:
  "once the site is live i don't see a reason not to submit the runs
  automatically"). The plugin then fetches each runner's PB for the
  current spot as split comparisons (the plugin side: attempts from other
  runners kept apart from the runner's own, per-runner PB - not built yet;
  `SplitTable` takes any `float[]` comparison already).
- **Identity:** runners are keyed on `RunnerId`, shown by their newest
  `RunnerName`. The id is `r-` + 16 hex digits of SHA-256 over
  `forestoverlay-runner|steam:<steamid64>` (`Game/RunnerIdentity`) - a
  plain Steam id would link to the profile from public files. A rename
  must never split one runner in two: show the name from their newest run.
  Non-Steam copies carry a random `r-` id from the config.
- **Only the same route compares:** key runs on segment id + route
  fingerprint (`Segment.RouteFingerprint`). A spot edited after publishing
  gets a new fingerprint; old runs show under "older version", never mixed.
- The site can serve the community index as a second URL
  (`Community.Url` in the plugin config, `Modules/CommunityModule`).

## The formats (all text, all already written by the plugin)

- **`.foseg`** - one segment: `Data/SegmentBundle` (header, `[segment]`,
  optional `[startstate]`, `[attempt]` sections). Tested round trip.
- **`[segment]` block** - `Data/SegmentFormat`: id, name, category, spawn,
  start / check / end triggers (`Data/Segments.cs`, `TriggerParser`),
  `split = <name>` after a check / end line (v0.24.146), restore,
  startstate hash, notes.
- **`.run` (an attempt)** - `Data/AttemptFormat` (pure, tested): `anchor`,
  `recorded`, `duration`, `route`, `splits|t1|t2...` (checkpoint times,
  cumulative, ms; the end is `duration`), `runner|<id>|<name>`,
  `channels|...`, `s|t|x|y|z|speed` (30 Hz path), `v|t|...` (5 Hz state).
  Files before v0.24.146 have no `splits` / `runner` lines.
- **Splits maths** - `Data/SplitTable` (PB, golds, sum of best, average,
  deltas, LiveSplit colours). The site should reproduce the same numbers;
  porting this file (or its tests) keeps both sides honest.
- Coordinates are Unity world metres (y up); the surface map spans about
  -1750..1750 on x / z; caves are below the terrain (y < 0 in places).

## Decided at the start of the build (2026-09-27)

- **Hosting (author):** the author's Oracle free-tier VPS (aarch64, Ubuntu
  minimal), Cloudflare in front (SSL Full), Caddy in Docker (`~/website`,
  network `caddy-navidrome`) as for deter.cloud and music.deter.cloud.
- **Stack (Claude, author: "up to you"):** ASP.NET Core (.NET 10) + SQLite
  + plain HTML / JS, one process, in the stock `aspnet:10.0` container on
  Caddy's network (`reverse_proxy forest-site:8080`, no host port). The
  server **links the plugin's own pure files** (`AttemptFormat`,
  `SplitTable`, `SegmentFormat`, `SegmentBundle`, with the tests' Unity
  shim) - one parser and one splits maths for game and site.
- **Repo (author: `site/` is fine):** `site/` in this repo.
- **Deploys (author asked for automatic):** `.github/workflows/site.yml` -
  test, publish linux-arm64, tarball over SSH to `site/deploy/deploy.sh`
  (a forced command: the key can run nothing else), container restart,
  live check. One-time setup: `site/deploy/README.md`.
- **Uploads:** a token per install (`POST /api/register`, first
  registration owns the runner id; the author can reset a token). Rate
  limits per IP (`CF-Connecting-IP`) and token, 4 MB bodies. A time under
  0.8 x the route's best (3+ runs) is flagged "under review".
- **First version (author agreed):** browse spots, upload / view runs per
  spot and route, per-runner best with splits, a 2D map with a scrub bar.
  3D terrain after.
- **Look (author):** minimalist, intuitive, The Forest's loading screen:
  its progress bar's yellow `rgb(229, 197, 1)` on black, `#222` backing,
  Montserrat (read from `HUD_Ngui/LoadCam` over the bridge). The logo's
  yellow is the same (229, 197, 0, from the author's cover art); its look
  is echoed with Anton (heavy condensed, uppercase) for the wordmark and
  titles - **not the logo image itself**, plus a "not affiliated with
  Endnight" footer (Claude's advice, 2026-09-27).

## What is built (2026-09-27, live at https://forest.deter.cloud)

- `site/ForestSite`: `Store` (SQLite + gzip run files), `Runs` (upload
  rules, community packs from `community/` shipped with the site, the
  JSON), `Program` (endpoints, rate limits, admin). Pages in `wwwroot`:
  spot list with search, a spot (map: zones, lines, ghost dots, play /
  scrub / speed; runners board with map toggles; splits vs #1 or best
  segments, LiveSplit colours; .run download; older route versions as
  chips), about. Phone width checked.
- `site/ForestSite.Tests`: 8 end-to-end tests (register, upload, board,
  golds, duplicates, refusals, moved zone = new route, flag, community,
  submissions).
- Checked locally with the author's real `s-splitstest01` attempts: all 6
  accepted (route fingerprints match the plugin's).
- API: `GET /api/spots`, `/api/spots/{id}`, `/api/spots/{id}/{route}/runner/{runner}`,
  `/api/runs/{id}` (path `[t,x,y,z,speed]`), `/api/runs/{id}/file`,
  `/api/spots/{id}/{route}/board.txt` (each runner's best as text for the
  plugin, `Data/SiteBoard`; runs under review left out);
  `POST /api/register` `{runner, name}` -> `{token}`, `POST /api/runs`
  (a `.foseg` with `[attempt]`s, Bearer token), `POST /api/submissions`;
  `/api/admin/...` with `X-Admin-Token` (own rate limit, 120 / min).
- **Clean paths** (author, 2026-09-27: the `#/` "doesn't look clean"):
  `/spot/<id>[/<route>]`, `/about`, `/admin[/<tab>]` - the server answers
  each with the page (mapped by name: the fallback skips paths with a
  dot, and old ids have dots); links move by `history.pushState`; an old
  `#/...` link is rewritten on load (plugins before v0.24.158 open those).
- **The admin page** (`/admin`, not in the nav; `wwwroot/admin.js`): the
  admin token typed once, kept in that browser's localStorage. Tabs:
  Submissions (the `[segment]` block, start state size, Download as
  `<slug>.foseg`, Approve / Reject / Back to open; after Approve the three
  publish steps), Under review (flagged runs: Looks fine = unflag, Hide /
  Show, Delete with a second click), Runners (runs, last upload, Ban,
  Reset token with a second click). The live token is in
  `/opt/forest-site/.env` on the VPS (`FOREST_ADMIN_TOKEN`); locally the
  `forest-site` preview uses `local-admin`.

The plugin side is done (v0.24.153-154, `Modules/RunUploadModule`):
each finished timed run is queued on disk and uploaded, on by default;
the Runs tab's Website section has the switch, the state, "Upload this
spot's saved runs" and "Open on the website".

## How spots get onto the site (2026-09-27)

- **A runner's own spot** appears by itself under "Runners' spots" with
  its first uploaded run (the upload carries the segment).
- **The spot's owner** is the runner who first uploaded a run on it
  (`routes.owner`, 2026-09-27): shown as "by <name>", and only their
  later uploads change its name, category and description (maks: a
  rename in game did not reach the site). A rename shows with the
  owner's next upload (a finished run, or *upload saved runs*).
- **Community spots** (the curated list every plugin fetches): the author
  approves. Today: Practice -> select -> Share -> Export writes
  `config/ForestOverlay/shared/<name>.foseg`; copy it into `community/`
  (an old entry with a `spot.my...` id gets a fresh `s-` id first -
  `community/README.md`), run `python scripts/community-index.py`, commit
  and push - CI checks the index, the site redeploys with it, plugins pick
  it up on their next startup check. Remove `demo-template.foseg` when the
  first real pack goes in.
- **Submissions (v0.24.158):** Practice -> Share -> *Submit to community*
  sends the saved entry + start state, never attempts
  (`RunUploadModule.Submit`; `SiteProtocol.SubmitRefusal`, shared with the
  site: an old-style id must be Duplicated first). A runner's second
  submit of a spot still open replaces it. The author approves on
  `/admin`; publishing is still the commit to `community/` above (the repo
  stays the source of truth) - maybe the GitHub API later.

## Next

1. ~~Other runners' PBs as comparisons in game~~ done (v0.24.155:
   `board.txt` + `Data/SiteBoard`, `Modules/PracticeRunModule.Site.cs`).
2. ~~A spot submission button in Practice; an admin page~~ done
   (v0.24.158; the in-game submit still to check against the live site).
3. The map: terrain heightmap underlay, then 3D.

## Useful from the game later

- Terrain heightmap for 3D: readable live over the bridge
  (`Terrain.activeTerrain.terrainData` heights / size) - dump once to a
  file for the site.
- Caves need a mesh dump (not done; their colliders are in the cave
  scenes).
