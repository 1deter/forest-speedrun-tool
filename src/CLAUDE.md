# Rules for plugin code (`src/`)

Loaded by itself when work touches `src/`. The map of features to files,
the UI and the plugin's gotchas: [`docs/areas/plugin.md`](../docs/areas/plugin.md);
how features behave: [`docs/areas/plugin-concepts.md`](../docs/areas/plugin-concepts.md).

## The module contract

`Plugin.cs` does lifecycle and composition only. Every feature is an
`OverlayModule`; adding one is a class in `src/Modules/` plus one line in
`BuildModules()`.

Modules never reach for globals or each other — shared services arrive via
`ModuleContext`; `Host.Find<T>()` covers the rare genuine collaboration.
Every module is individually try/caught at every hook: one that throws is
disabled and logged, the rest keep running.

## Rules for modules

- **Never allocate in `DrawTab`/`OnGUI`.** Build strings in `Tick` (throttled)
  and cache `GUIContent`. Long lists must be virtualised.
- **Declare `IsPracticeOnly`** if it writes game state, and call
  `Ctx.Practice.Mark(...)` at each entry point that does.
- **Lay panels out vertically**, not packed across a row at fixed offsets —
  that clips on narrow widths.
- **If it can fail invisibly, show why on screen.** A dead toggle, an empty
  search and a timer that never starts were all reported as "nothing happens".
- **Variable text goes through `Core/UiText.Draw`** — status lines, errors,
  descriptions, anything whose length is not fixed. It wraps to the width
  given, takes the height it needs and returns it; the caller adds that to
  `y`. A fixed `GUI.Label(new Rect(x, y, w, 20), text)` is only for short
  constant text and virtualised list rows. The author reported clipped text
  three times in one session (cut in half when wrapping in 20 px, cut off
  on the right when not, running under the list) — this rule is the fix.
  A message goes **where the click was** (under its button); with no panel
  open it goes to `Ctx.Notice` (upper middle, a few seconds).
