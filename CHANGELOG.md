# Changelog

Newest first, one short section per release, written for runners. CI puts
the section for a tag into its GitHub release, and the in-game **Updates**
tab shows it: what an update brings, and what the installed version
changed. A tag without a section here fails the release build.

## v0.23.1 - 2026-09-23

- Load slowdown, first fix: every quick-load or savestate load kept the old
  world's pathfinding (about 120 MB) in memory, because the game skips its
  cleanup when it reloads over itself. The overlay now runs that cleanup.
  Switch in the Savestates tab if you need it off.

## v0.23.0 - 2026-09-23

- Updates tab: shows what's new in the latest version (this list).
- Memory: every load now logs the game's memory use, plus a report of what
  the game keeps from earlier loads - for tracking down the load slowdown.
  Savestates tab: "Memory census now", and a switch to turn the per-load
  report off.

## v0.22.7 - 2026-09-23

- Timed runs: checkpoints can no longer be skipped. The end waits until
  every checkpoint has fired (the Runs tab says which one is missing; F12
  skips it). A checkpoint that is already met when you reach it - the
  keycard already in your bag, already standing in its zone - fires at once.
- Run lines from a previous segment are cleared when you go to another
  spot.
- Inventory tab fills in as soon as it opens.
- Savestates from another save no longer delete the weapon-upgrade spots
  (feathers, teeth, glass) on your weapons.
- Messages show under the button you clicked; less work every frame while
  the window is open.
